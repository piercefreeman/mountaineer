## Client Builder

Our "client builder" collection of classes manages generating the Typescript definitions from
the defined Python controllers. While this component doesn't affect the actual value of the parsed
values retrieved from the `fetched()` API at runtime, it's critical for development (IDE typehints
and CI static typechecking). Working with semantic types that are always in sync with the backend
is one of the core benefits of using Mountaineer.

## Evolution

In our 0.1-0.8 releases, the client builder operated on the OpenAPI schema that was generated from
the API server. This ensured that definitions always matched the JS-like typing of the OpenAPI.
There were some limitations to this approach:

- Loss of inheritance tree: Each controller provided flat functions into the OpenAPI schema,
  without any of their class inheritance structure. This made it impossible to define function
  signatures in TS that relied on a common ancessor without specifying all of the downstream
  client subclasses.
- Formatting of enum: Enums only define their values within OpenAPI, not their Python names.
  We would build up a synthetic enum key/value pair based on the string value but in cases
  where key/value in Python were meaningfully different (e.g. `Enum("foo", "bar")`), we would
  lose that information.

In 0.9 we moved to a new approach that uses the Python controllers directly to generate the
TypeScript definitions. This corrects all of the drawbacks of the OpenAPI approach in addition
to cleaning up the code to more easily make extensions in the future.

Our new architecture is structured like:

```
-> In-Memory Controllers

-> Parser: Extracts all metadata of the controllers/models necessary to generate TypeScript definitions

  -> ControllerWrapper
  -> FieldWrapper
  -> ActionWrapper
  -> ModelWrapper
  -> EnumWrapper

-> InterfaceBuilder: Takes the metadata and generates isolated TypeScript definitions for just that
  piece of the API

  -> ControllerInterface
  -> ModelInterface
  -> EnumInterface
  -> ActionInterface

-> FileGenerators: Write the full TypeScript files to disk, which often requires collecting
  multiple interfaces, tracking their imports, and assembling into a single file

```

## Watch Server

Used by Mountaineer CLI hooks to isolate your server and push updates to live-reload browsers. You probably won't have to deal with this class explicitly.
